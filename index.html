              Hot on the heels of the Barcelona media launch of its globally
              unique Ninja 7 Hybrid, Kawasaki has now doubled its presence in
              this exclusive market with the announcement of the Z 7 Hybrid.
            </h1>
            <p>
              Harnessing the same innovative, unique* and groundbreaking
              technology as its fully faired sibling, the 2024 Z7 Hybrid is a
              naked style bike <br />

              <br />� or should that be bikes? as it is effectively three
              machines in one thanks to electric power allied to hybrid and
              internal combustion technologies. With two power sources, a 43.5kw
              max power 451cc water-cooled four-stroke twin cylinder internal
              combustion engine and a 9kw maximum rated electric traction motor,
              the latest (and most technically advanced) <br />
              <br />
              � Z is ready for what the city, the suburbs and countryside can
              challenge it with <br />
              <br />� plus come back for more! Calling out its strong hybrid**
              credentials, the Z7 Hybrid can operate in three ways. As a full EV
              with automatic transmission, the machine is suitable for zero
              emission zones and can operate for up to 12kms on electric only
              before the internal combustion engine seamlessly provides battery
              charge <br />
              <br />� remember this is a true Hybrid so the machine recharges
              itself. In Eco-Hybrid mode, the electric motor works in harmony
              with the internal combustion engine providing a "best of both
              worlds" solution offering the choice of either six speed automatic
              transmission or manual gear selection via "up and down" paddles on
              the left handlebar <br />
              <br />� which, naturally, features no clutch lever. A "walk mode"
              is also a feature for ease of manoeuvring and parking plus
              selectable auto engine stop at standstill reflecting current
              automotive thinking. Finally, sports mode unleashes the full
              performance potential of both the electric and gasoline motors
              with the addition of an "E-Boost" function (via a paddle switch on
              the right handlebar) that effectively harnesses all the potential
              power available in a short five second burst for litre class
              acceleration from a standing start or truly impressive thrust
              while riding. Matched to a potential for fuel economy in the 250cc
              class category, the Z7 Hybrid truly represents the best of both
              worlds and looks set to change the game. Relying on the same
              trellis type chassis layout and running gear as the Ninja 7
              Hybrid, the 'Sugomi' styled Z7 Hybrid opens up a new world in the
              naked class sector while doubling the Strong Hybrid offer from
              Kawasaki in the market from one to two machines. Expected to be on
              sale during the Spring of 2024, the Z 7 Hybrid moves Kawasaki
              firmly to centre stage in the constantly evolving universe of
              powered-two-wheeler technology. Colours Z 7 Hybrid: • Metallic
              Bright Silver/Metallic Matte Lime Green/Ebony (SL1) =
              COMMUNICATION COLOUR • Metallic Matte Graphenesteel
              Gray/Ebony/Metallic Graphite Gray (GY1)- *1 Mass production models
              (excluding scooters) from a major power sports manufacturer as of
              October 6, 2023, per Kawasaki Motors, Ltd. research. **2 Strong
              hybrid systems combine an internal combustion engine (ICE) with an
              electric motor for powerful riding, and because of their large
              battery capacity they are able to run on electricity alone.

            <h1>TVS Apache RR 310 Review – Design</h1>
            <p>
              The new TVS Apache RR 310 doesn’t have the carbon fibre body that
              the Akula concept did. However, the upcoming TVS Apache 310 model
              still looks a lot like the concept motorcycle. Akin to the Akula,
              it looks very racy and very attractive. The Apache RR 310 gets a
              huge front-fairing, a huge windshield and a split headlamp setup.
              The headlamps hold HID projector setups, which further enhance the
              premiumness quotient of this bike. The LED DRLs further lend that
              touch of stylishness. Both the headlamps will be ON even on low
              beam.This motorcycle gets a cast alloy swingarm to improve
              handling. At the same time, we’re hoping the suspension to offer
              decent ride quality over most surfaces. The USD forks come painted
              in golden, which further make the bike look sportier. The bike’s
              ‘devil’s horn’ taillamp catches attention at the rear.

            <h1>Yamaha R1</h1>
            <p>
              Yamaha has always been at the forefront of technological
              innovation, and the R1 is a prime example of this commitment. This
              motorcycle is equipped with cutting-edge electronics that have
              been carefully designed to improve performance and safety. The
              Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) and Yamaha Chip Controlled
              Intake (YCC-I) systems optimize throttle response and intake
              efficiency, ensuring a smooth and thrilling riding experience. One
              impressive technological feature of the R1 is the Inertial
              Measurement Unit (IMU). By constantly monitoring the bike's
              movements, this system allows for the inclusion of features like
              the Yamaha Launch Control System (LCS) and Slide Control System
              (SCS). This gives riders exceptional control and confidence,
              especially in high-performance situations.
